% * Put the full reference to the paper at the top of the paper (as part of the
%   title) OR on the title slide

% * Describe the motivation for the research * What are the research questions
%   or hypotheses? These should be explicit in the paper.

% * Describe how the research was conducted in terms of system/component
%   design, and the basis in theory.

% * How was the research question/hypothesis tested?  Describe how the study
%   was conducted (e.g. number of people, their characteristics, the tasks done,
%   what was measured) or how the case study was accomplished (e.g. company
%   studied, characteristics, process, what was measured).

% * What were the results of the research?  To what degree is the research
%   relevant in how society uses techology now or in addressing gaps of how
%   technology is used?

% What is turned in: Your presentation slides OR paper in .doc(x) and pdf

% ============================================================================

% aesthetic, efficiency, effectiveness ~ visualization
% task-abandon-latency ~ visualization
% response-time-error ~ visualization

% Shown correlation between aesthetic against efficiency, effectiveness
% Data visualization is an important problem

% This research attempts to fill this gap by investigating the relationship
% between aesthetic in data visualization and measures of effectiveness and
% efficiency, here supplemented with task abandonment and erroneous response
% time metrics.

% Not a beauty contest.
% Not a speed competition.

% task abandonment -> quit from frustration
% erroneus response latency -> length of time taken by a participant who
%   generates an incorrect answer.
% user patience -> duration between completion/abandonment

% NOTE: terms taken from previous WEBSITE-BASED study.

% H_0: Our hypothesis is that aesthetic will have an effect on extending the
%   latency of task abandonment and duration of erroneous response time.

% Got data visualizer from whatver source was most feasible (time, effort)

% Data source: file directory system (with pictures, documents)

% Same COLOR, SIZE, TYPOGRAPHY, DATA SOURCE, NO INTERACTION (reduce confounding)

% Use online survey b/c:
%   large number of participants needed (from many factors)
%   Computer screen is "native delivery method"

% Participants were recruited via online message boards, mailing lists and
% weblog postings across a variety of different demographic targets.

% Tracked (anonymous) gender, languages, comp exp, age, comp usage as
%   explanaation factor for aesthetics value

% Standard 1024x768 browser size used

% Survey: aesthetics and task performance sections

% Used ANOVA (with randomization to address independence) (only 7 vis for time)

% AESTHETIC
%   Individual (slider, no numbers)
%   Group (for clustering effect)

% TASK PERFORMANCE
%   14 Questions, 7 Visualizations
%   Random order (confounding question difficulty)
%   Multiple choice (6 answers including "cannot tell")
%   AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

% Considered only unique, completed responses (n = 285)
% Vector is for those with formal design background, but "spread to others"

% RESULTS

% * Logical groupings of visualization techniques by categorical
%   appearance did not necessarily occur. (ex. 3d results inconsistent)

% * TreeMap, a longestablished data mapping technique finished amongst
%   this group with a correct response rate of 32%. Contrarily, SunBurst
%   displays an accuracy rate of 84%, surpassing the mark of 81% received
%   by Windows Explorer, disproving the notion that the familiarity of
%   Explorer would result in the highest effectiveness of any method.

% * PolarView received a higher aesthetic rank, averaging second highest
%   in the group ranking task.

% * BeamTrees, the technique that received the lowest subjective aesthetic
%   ranking and effectiveness, participants recorded an average duration
%   of 27.7 seconds per question.

% * Scattered latency/aesthetic values -- very good/bad aesthetics might
%   mean largest latency times.

% * Abandonment times are varied/scattered

% * Beautiful is usable (SunBurst, counter Botanical)
% * Effective/Efficient not necessarily beautiful

% DISCUSSION

% * Different views are better for different data sets?
% * Maybe pallete had an effect (vs. earth-tone or greyscale)

% CONCLUSIONS

% * Task abandonment and Error latency as measures for User Experience
% * Attractive -> Longer user patience

% This supports statements by Norman [22] in that, “it is
% only through our emotions do we unravel problems, as
% the human emotional system is intertwined with our
% cognitive abilities”; if the user finds a positive affection
% towards an object, our brains are encouraged to think
% creatively in order to solve any problem in which the
% object might present.
